<!-- the syntax @{/list/values} to generate a link within a Thymleaf template,
but we haven't seen the other portion of the link: (column=${column.key}).
This syntax will cause Thymeleaf to generate query parameters for our URL based
on the key/value pairs specified.
In list.html, we specify a query parameter named column by using column=.
The value of the query parameter is determined dynamically based on the value
of ${column.key}. Since these values come from columnChoices in the controller,
they will be employer, location, etc. When the user clicks on these links,
they will be routed to the listColumnValues handler in ListController,
which looks for this parameter.
In your browser, click on the Location link. This sends a request as
we just outlined, resulting in a list of all of the locations in the data set.
The page you're seeing at /list/values?column=location is generated by the
list-column.html template. It has a similar structure as list.html,
with the exception that the various links are presented in a table,
and their URLs have not one, but two, query parameter attributes:
one for the column and one for the value. In the case of the locations list,
these will result in URL paths like:
/list/jobs?column=location&value=Kansas%20City
(Note that Thymeleaf inserts %20 for us, to represent a space,
and may actually be hidden in your browser's address bar).
Clicking on these links will display a list of jobs in the given location,
via the listJobsByColumnAndValue handler method. However, that display isn't working yet.
While the handler method is fully implemented, as we noted above, the view
template needs some additional work.
